# 169. Majority Element

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
* `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
